## Overview

usedthese is a family of functions to summarise R package & function usage in Quarto documents consistent with knitr's syntax highlighting:

1.  `used_here()` adds a nicely-rendered summary table of usage to a single document;

2.  `used_there()` harvests the tables created above to aggregate usage for a website ready for analysis;

3.  `used_elsewhere()` harvests tables for opted-in websites to enable analysis of a broader view of usage [Planned];

4.  `used_where()` finds pages on your website (or opted-in websites) that use a specified function [Planned].

## Example Use Case

Each "little project" on the Quarto website [quantumjitter.com](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/) focuses on a data science technique or machine learning model to analyse real-world data. At the foot of each of these is a quantified view of the R packages and functions used in the associated code. This is achieved by including `used_here()` in each Quarto document.

`used_there()` harvests all the tables created by `used_here()` to enable a [Favourite Things](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/box/) article on how R packages and functions are used across the website.

I personally find this approach makes it easier for me to check for consistency of usage, acknowledge the packages I most need to keep abreast of (or go deeper on), and spot opportunities for updates to the latest and greatest.

When the Tidyverse blog announced changes to [dplyr](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/11/dplyr-1-1-0-is-coming-soon/) and [purrr](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/12/purrr-1-0-0/) a quick review of my [Favourite Things](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/box/) identified a number of opportunities to try out the exciting new features. For example, dplyr introduced temporary grouping with the `.by` argument for mutate and amigos. `group_by()` and `ungroup()` had been used many times and most of these occurrences could be replaced with the new more concise approach.

## Installation
