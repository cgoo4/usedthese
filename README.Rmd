# usedthese

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The overall goal of usedthese is to:

1.  With `used_here()`, make it super easy to add a nicely-rendered summary table of R package & function usage, consistent with knitr's syntax highlighting, to the foot of a rendered Quarto or R Markdown document. [Development version available.]

2.  With `used_there()`, harvest multiple such tables to create an overall summary of usage for your website. [Statement of future intent.]

3.  With `used_elsewhere()`, websites deploying the usedthese package, and where the owners have explicitly chosen to add their website url to a participation list, may be analysed for a broader view of package & function usage. [Statement of future intent.]

4.  With `used_where()`, for a supplied specific function example use cases may be found from websites participating per 3. [Statement of future intent.]

## Case Study

Each "little project" on [quantumjitter.com](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/) focuses on a data science technique or machine learning model to analyse real-world data. At the foot of each of these is a concise quantified view of the R packages and functions used in the associated code. This is achieved by including `used_here()` in each Quarto document.

`used_there()` harvests all the tables created by `used_here()` to enable a [Favourite Things](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/box/) view of how R packages and functions are used right across quantumjitter.com.

When an updated version of dplyr introduced the `.by` argument for mutate and friends, it was helpful to see how many times `group_by()` and `ungroup()` had been used across all projects. And after updating the projects where it made sense to do so, it was interesting to see the overall impact of the changes on usage.
