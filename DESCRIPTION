Description: Reads a .R, .Rmd or .qmd file. Extracts and counts the R 
    functions used. Summarises and arranges the package and function 
    usage in a table. The package is powered by knitr::purl to remove 
    code from a .Rmd or .qmd, and by highr::latext to identify functions 
    consistent with RStudio's syntax highlighting.
