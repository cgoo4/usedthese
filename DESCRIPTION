Description: Reads an R script, R Markdown file or Quarto document. 
    Extracts and counts the R packages and
    functions used. Summarises and arranges the  
    usage in a table. The package is powered by knitr::purl to grab the  
    code and by highr::hi_latex to identify functions 
    consistent with RStudio's syntax highlighting.
