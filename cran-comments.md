## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Fixed example > 5 secs on Debian: Benchmarked a 10-fold improvement across 100 runs
* Confirming the maintainer name & email are correct

* Fixed spelling: 'knitr' now in quotes (as it's a package name)
* Fixed DESCRIPTION & CITATION url
* Changed Depends to R (>= 4.1): Pipe added in this release
