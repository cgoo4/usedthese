Having added `used_here()` to several of your Quarto website pages, you may want to make an overall site analysis of your package and function usage. `used_there()` scrapes and consolidates the tables into a `tibble` ready for analysis:

```{r}

used_there("https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/")
```

[Favourite Things](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/box/) shows an example analysis which takes the tibble output from `used_there()`, augments these data with a category, and plots the most-used packages, the most-used functions and a word cloud.
