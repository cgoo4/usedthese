  collapse = TRUE,

```{r setup}
library(usedthese)
```

Having added `used_here()` to several of your Quarto website pages, you may want to make an overall site analysis of your package and function usage. [Favourite Things](https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/box/) shows an example analysis which takes the tibble output from `used_there()`:

```{r}

used_there("https://www.quantumjitter.com/project/")
```
